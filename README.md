# spaceminer
A 3D space mining game.

You just float around and collect space rocks.

So asteroids have 5 elements:
- `[orange, top left]` **Break** _(this allows you to collect/break asteroids, without this, you are essentially dead)_
- `[green, top right]` **Shield** _(getting too close to asteroids damages your shield, with no shield the damage goes straight to your fuel tank)_
- `[purple, bottom left]` **Stop** _(asteroids generally don't move that fast but if you want to stop all the ones near you, this will do just that)_
- `[dark, bottom right]` **Repel** _(allows you to push asteroids away from you)_
- `[aqua, back of player]` **Fuel** _(allows you to move around, without this, you are essentially dead)_

The quantity of each element is represented by coloured cubic segments on the spaceman. You can see roughly what each asteroid has by the colour tints on the asteroid surface, but it's just an indicator, you never know, there could be 'gold' below surface level.

The aim of the game, whatever you want, try and mine every asteroid if you can. Or just see how long you can survive in space.

It can be hard to appreciate how many triangles are rendered in each frame, excluding the astronaut, all of the asteroids make up 1.3 Million (1,310,720) triangles spread across 16,384 draw calls. This is an amicable amount of triangles per frame for most modern computers to render meaning that this game should render at a high framerate across the board.
